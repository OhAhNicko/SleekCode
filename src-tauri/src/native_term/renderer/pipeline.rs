// R1.b renderer: wgpu surface + glyphon text pass.
//
// Phase 0 used a hardcoded 4-quad colored flag to prove the HWND + wgpu
// pipeline path; R1.b replaces that with a real text renderer driven by
// glyphon. The Phase-0 vertex/shader machinery is gone — glyphon owns its
// own pipeline and shader (`glyphon-0.6.0/src/shader.wgsl`).
//
// Sub-deliverable boundaries:
//   - R1.b: surface + glyphon stack + static "Hello, MADE" fallback when no
//     Term is attached. If a Term IS attached (via `attach_term`), render its
//     visible grid.
//   - R1.c: `attach_term` wires from the new `native_term_attach_pty` cmd.
//   - R1.d: per-cell SGR colors, background quads, cursor pass.
